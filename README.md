# SharpOMatic

SharpOMatic is an open-source workflow builder focused on AI-driven tasks.

## Configuration over code

One of the biggest challenges when building an AI-focused workflow is cycle time. 
Constantly changing code to try new ideas slows you down. 
AI is notorious for needing lots of experiments to find the right combination of model, prompts, tool calls, and glue logic to get the outcome you need. 
Using SharpOMatic, you can prefer configuration over code, which lets you iterate on ideas much faster.

## Host your own execution

The execution engine is hosted in your project so you retain complete control over the environment and storage of all data. 
There is no reliance on other providers, so you control access, permissions, uptime, and scaling.

## Deep integration

SharpOMatic is a .NET native project, so you can use familiar C# for glue logic in workflow code nodes. 
You can call from code nodes directly into your backend code for fast, simple integration. 
Expose your C# types for structured outputs and C# functions for tool calling.
