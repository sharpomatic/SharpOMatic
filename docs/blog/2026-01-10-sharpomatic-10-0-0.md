I am excited to announce SharpOMatic 10.0.0, our first release.
The version number matches the .NET framework version we target: .NET 10.0.

## What is included

- A workflow engine built for AI-focused orchestration.
- An embedded editor UI for designing, running, and debugging workflows.
- An ASP.NET Core host for local development and integration.
- Documentation covering setup and core concepts.

## What next

The first release has minimal functionality, like all first releases.
I will be interating quickly to flesh out out the functionality.
If there are any requests then just raises an issue on GitHub.
