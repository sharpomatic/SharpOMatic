SharpOMatic is an open-source workflow builder focused on AI-driven tasks. It combines a browser-based editor with a .NET runtime so you can design workflows visually, run them locally or in your own ASP.NET Core host, and extend behavior with C# code nodes.

## What you can do

- Build workflows with nodes for models, code, branching, and orchestration.
- Run and debug workflows with rich run state and persisted history.
- Embed the editor into your own ASP.NET Core host.
- Extend the engine with new nodes, metadata, and services.

## Project layout

- Frontend UI: `src/SharpOMatic.FrontEnd`
- Editor host: `src/SharpOMatic.Editor`
- Workflow engine: `src/SharpOMatic.Engine`
- Sample host: `src/SharpOMatic.Server`

## How this documentation is organized

Use the getting starting guides to be up and running in a few minutes are run some of the sample workflows. Or read the Core Concepts to understand the runtime model and data flow.
